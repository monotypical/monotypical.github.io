title: About

Hello, I'm a terminally online software developer from Bath in the UK, and this is where I post things. Sometimes.

I currently work for [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com/), a public sector technology company, where I modernise legacy applications. Previously, I have worked for the internet security company [Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/) on anti-phishing services. I graduated from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) with a Master of Engineering degree in Computing in 2019.
