Hello, I'm a terminally online software developer, and this is where I post things. Sometimes.

This site is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic) theme, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The favicon is  "Woman Technologist: Light Skin Tone" from [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/).
